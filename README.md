# Text-to-Speech-app-aws

1- I created the lambda function and uloaded my code from chatGpt. 
2- Deployed my API gatway and enable CORS for users in other domains to reach my application. 
3- Created S3 bucket to store audio files there made sure is public access and Versioning is enabled. 
4- uploaded my html file to amplify to host the web application, why Amplify? because its secure and relible. 


note: i faced alot of issues in premissions i was getting 404 errors until i enable CORS for both my API and S3 bucket, also i faced in issue with frontend code after its getting the audio url from api the formatting was not matching, 
      it created 404 error in website console. 

this web application its for learning how to connect AWS services all togather to provide a technical solution or solve a problem.
